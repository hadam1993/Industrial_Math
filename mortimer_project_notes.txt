- had problems with python installation on bridges (?)
- switched to mortimer
- steps to get python running on mortimer:
	- UWM HPC: https://uwm.edu/hpc/
	- followed steps described here: https://www.psc.edu/user-resources/software/anaconda
	- created miniconda env using Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh(url) to have access to conda package manager
	- installed torch, transformers, wordninja, pattern, nltk, scikit-learn, spacy, torchvision
	- wrote sbatch script
	- downloaded distilbert files because of memory constraints of jobs on gpu partition from url:
		- model: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/distilbert-base-uncased-pytorch_model.bin
		- config: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/distilbert-base-uncased-config.json
	- load distilbert from local file
	- modify ordered_dict keys in distilbert state_dict: remove prefix 'distilbert.'
	- RUN!
- no parallelization for our specific program :(
- include runtime plots(?) on mortimer
