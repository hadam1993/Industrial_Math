- had problems with python installation on bridges (?)
- switched to mortimer
- steps to get python running on mortimer:
	- followed steps described here: <find_url>
	- created miniconda env using Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh(url) to have access to conda package manager
	- installed torch, transformers, wordninja, pattern, nltk, scikit-learn, spacy, torchvision
	- wrote sbatch script
	- downloaded distilbert files because of memory constraints of jobs on gpu partition
	- load distilbert from local file
	- modify ordered_dict keys in distilbert state_dict: remove prefix 'distilbert.'
	- RUN!
- no parallelization for our specific program :(
- include runtime plots(?) on mortimer
